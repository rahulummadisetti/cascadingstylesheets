What's inside this Module ?

Theory - Which Units can we Use ?
"%" and the containing block
"min-width" & "max-width"
understanding "rem" vs "em"
working with "vw" and "vh"

How is the Size Calculated ?

Absolute Lengths :

- Mostly ignore user settings

    - px 


Viewport Lengths 

- Adjust to current viewport

    - vh 
    - vw
    - vmin
    - vmax


Font-Relative Lengths

- Adjust to default font size

    - rem
    - em

%

How is the Box size for % units calculated ?


3 rules to remember :
---------------------

Element position: fixed;

Viewport     Element  position:fixed;


Ancestor 
--------     Element  position:absolute
content
+padding 


Ancestor
---------     Element position:static / position : relative  (block level element)
content


Units :

pixels (px)
percentages (%)
rem & em 
viewport (vh % vw)
auto


The Containing Block 

The reference point when applying % units to an element.
Depends on the position property applied to this element.
Can be the closest ancestor or the viewport.


100% Height

The element itself and the ancestors use position static/relative => 100% height is not working 
Adding 100% height to all ancestors fixes this issues.
Position fixed/absolute or using viewport units (vw or vh) as alternatives
